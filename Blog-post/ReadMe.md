## Data Scientist Nanodegree

You can read about this in my blog [here](https://medium.com/@yashk.edu/a-story-about-developers-around-the-world-from-stack-overflow-survey-4188f59a1c25).

### Tools and Libraries required
You need to have Python 3.x version and following libraries to run this file.

- seaborn==0.10.1
- plotly==4.4.1
- pandas==1.0.5
- numpy==1.18.5
- matplotlib==3.2.2

And you need to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Summary of the Project

After my analysis on  Stack Overflow Survey Data 2019 these are my conclusions drawn from it.

* We can see that HTML/CSS is the most used languge followed by Javascript. As these languages are most used by web developers so we find that many developers are using these Languages.
* We can see that most of developers are from United states , followed by India, Germany , Uk.
* We can see a linear increase in the salary as the experience increase for the data scientist or Machine learning specialist role.
 
### Project Motivation

This is a very good opurtunity to work on the Stack OverFlow survey data from 2019 having information about developers from over 180 countries and responses of nearly 65K.
As I have passion for learning data science so I wished to analyse the data about the salaries these data scientist earn based on different metrics.
For more information refer to my  medium blogpost on this project [here](https://medium.com/@yashk.edu/a-story-about-developers-around-the-world-from-stack-overflow-survey-4188f59a1c25).

### Data Descriptions

It consists of 2 csv files :
- survey_results_public.csv has the data about the reponse from the survey.
- survey_results_schema.csv has the schema for the dataset provided.
